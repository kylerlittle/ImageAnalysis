# **Notes:**
**1.** Draw a black box/outline around the object being imaged. The box need only be a different color
       than the object being imaged. This allows the autocrop feature to function well.
**2.** Type 'make help' into the terminal for instructions on features of the program.
**3.** Once this is fully functional, I will post very detailed instructions.
