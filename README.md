# mk-topo-map
## Preparation
1. Place the object to be imaged on a uniformly colored background. The background should be a different color than the object being imaged. This allows the autocrop feature to function well.
1. Set up translational stage to move across a (-*x* + *f*, *f* + *x*) interval, where *f* is the focal length of the camera and *x* is an amount slightly larger than the height of the object divided by two.
