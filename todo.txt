Current To-Dos:

**Actually have real data now! Woohoo!

1. Make pre-crop-- to start, crop first & last images in rawImagesTest (either), so that fiber is left in tact,
   		   but you cannot see the optical table. Then run pre-crop on all. Then make crop.
2. Finish graph function in 3D_plotting.py.
   	  First, make default view right side up (rather than upside down).
3. Need to initialize self.threeDmodel correctly! I know I don't know the side at the start of the program
   so it's a little bit tricky. However, this is screwing up my graph function.
4. Figure out a clever way of adding the xy dimensions to the model
   	  (should be better than simply having the user measure the length/width of the black box;
	  however, to start, I'll use that to show Kuzyk)
5. Update makefile as necessary.


Once project actually functions:
1. Create virtualenv so that others in the research group can easily use this software.
2. Make as user-friendly as possible.
3. Update README.txt with explicit instructions.
