Current To-Dos:

**Actually have real data now! Woohoo!

1. Finish graph function. Accept parameters: tuple: (len, width), so that xy dimensions are actually real and accurate.
2. Run a full test on real data.
3. Set up a long test where parameters are varied. Pick the best one.


Once project actually functions:
1. Create virtualenv so that others in the research group can easily use this software.
2. Make as user-friendly as possible.
3. Update README.txt with explicit instructions.
