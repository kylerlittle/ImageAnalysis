Currently working on initializing variables correctly by finding type of variance Matrix
Also need to adjust outer 'for' loops to get the iterator... (or find a way around this)
Gotta run to class; will finish after

Current To-Dos:
1. Finish implementing 3D model creator.
2. Update makefile as necessary.


Once project actually functions:
1. Create virtualenv so that others in the research group can easily use this software.
2. Make as user-friendly as possible.
3. Update README.txt with explicit instructions.
